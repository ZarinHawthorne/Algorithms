# Data Structures

### Week 8

The code demonstrates an understanding of various fundamental data structures and their unique behaviors through practical examples. 
It uses an array to store and iterate over a fixed-size collection of integers, showcasing its ability to provide direct indexed access. 
A dictionary (map) is used to associate unique keys with values, highlighting its suitability for key-value pair storage and fast lookups. 
The stack is employed to demonstrate Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior by pushing and popping elements in reverse order of insertion. Similarly, a queue is utilized to showcase First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior, where elements are dequeued in the order they were enqueued. 
These implementations illustrate a solid grasp of how each data structure is designed to solve specific problems efficiently and with appropriate access patterns.
